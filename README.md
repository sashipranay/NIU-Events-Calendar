# NIU-Events-Calendar
Our proposed system is a new system which focuses more on the events calendar and allows user to get notifications or reminders for the events they have registered to. In the Existing system, if a person registers for an event, he will be notified through outlook, but not every event is notified. He might miss the updates or events which he might be interested in if he failed to check the college portal. To overcome this, our application enables the user to get notified through alerts, reminders for the event he registered to through Text message, In-app notifications, and outlook. If the user is not sure about the eventâ€™s name, then it will be difficult for the user to search for the event and register to it in our existing system. Our application enhances the existing search system by adding keyword search and time period search, where the user can use either of the search patterns or he can use both the search patterns to search for the event and register to it. We also added an additional feature where the user when registered for an event, all his details will be saved and all the basic details will be auto-filled when he registers for another event saving time and reducing the effort to re-write the information, and if any additional information is required, that will be filled by the user.
